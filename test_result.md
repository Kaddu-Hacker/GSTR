#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
##
## frontend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.js"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false
##     status_history:
##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

##   test_sequence: 0
##   run_ui: false
##
## test_plan:
##   current_focus:
##     - "Task name 1"
##     - "Task name 2"
##   stuck_tasks:
##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
##   test_all: false
##   test_priority: "high_first"  # or "sequential" or "stuck_first"
##
## agent_communication:
##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        - Verify all GSTR-1 sections are generated correctly
      
      📝 PREVIOUS MESSAGE (Oct 18, 2025 - 17:44):
      
      🎯 FINAL SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:
      ✅ BACKEND DOWNLOAD ENDPOINT: Created new server-side download endpoint
        - New endpoint: GET /api/download/{upload_id}/{file_type}
        - File types supported: 'gstr1b' and 'gstr3b'
        - Returns file with proper Content-Disposition header to trigger browser download
        - Tested and verified working with curl
        - Headers include: Content-Disposition: attachment; filename=GSTR1B_092025.json
        - This method is much more reliable than client-side blob downloads
      
      ✅ FRONTEND UPDATED: Changed to use backend download endpoint
        - File: /app/frontend/src/App.js
        - Simplified downloadJSON function to use backend URL
        - No more blob creation or data URLs
        - Creates link with backend endpoint and triggers click
        - This will properly trigger browser's download dialog
      
      🔧 PREVIOUS FIXES:
      ✅ PYDANTIC MODEL_DUMP FIX: Fixed all model_dump() calls to use mode='json'
        - Issue: Pydantic v2 model_dump() without mode='json' may return non-JSON-serializable objects
        - Fixed files: /app/backend/server.py (6 locations)
        - Changed model_dump() to model_dump(mode='json') for:
          * Upload objects (line 113)
          * File info objects (line 115)
          * Invoice line objects (line 191)
          * GSTR1B export objects (lines 277, 289, 301)
          * GSTR3B export objects (lines 284, 293, 302)
        - Backend restarted and tested successfully
        - API response verified to be valid JSON
      
      ✅ ENHANCED DOWNLOAD FUNCTION: Added comprehensive logging and improved error handling
        - File: /app/frontend/src/App.js
        - Added step-by-step console logging (10 steps)
        - Added setTimeout for cleanup to prevent premature removal
        - Added detailed error logging with stack traces
        - This will help identify if the issue is in the download function itself
      
      🎯 TESTING NEEDED:
      - User needs to test the download buttons again
      - Check browser console for detailed logs
      - Verify both GSTR-1B and GSTR-3B downloads work
      
      🎯 LATEST FIXES (Oct 18, 2025 - 16:56):
      ✅ NONE VALUE ERROR FIXED: "unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'int' and 'NoneType'" resolved
        - Fixed all sum() operations to handle None values: Changed from .get('key', 0) to (.get('key') or 0)
        - Fixed all += operations to handle None values in aggregations
        - Fixed Decimal() conversions to handle None values properly
        - Updated files:
          * /app/backend/server.py: Lines 290-294, 469-473, 489-493
          * /app/backend/gstr_generator.py: Lines 167-170, 247-250
          * /app/backend/utils.py: Lines 271-274
          * /app/backend/gemini_service.py: Lines 168-169
        - All numeric aggregations now properly convert None to 0 before calculations
      
      ✅ AI INSIGHTS REMOVED: User requested removal of AI insights
        - Removed Gemini AI invoice analysis from /api/generate/{upload_id}
        - Removed Gemini AI filing insights from /api/preview/{upload_id}
        - Response now returns only GSTR JSON files and validation warnings
        - No more "ai_insights" field in API responses
